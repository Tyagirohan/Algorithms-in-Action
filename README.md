# 🚀 Algorithms in Action

**Week 2 of Learning DSA in Public** - Building real, interactive projects to master the most famous algorithms.

Following up on [Build with DSA](https://github.com/Tyagirohan/build-with-dsa), this series takes it up a notch by implementing classic algorithms through practical, visually stunning web applications.

## 🎯 The Approach

Each day, I:
1. 📖 Learn a famous algorithm
2. 💻 Build an interactive visualizer
3. 🎨 Make it beautiful and educational
4. 🌐 Host it live
5. 📱 Share on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-tyagi-333675202/)

## 📚 Projects

### **Day 1: Binary Search** 🔍
**Project**: Smart Library Search Engine

A visual comparison of Binary Search vs Linear Search with animated book library.

- ✅ Three search modes (Binary, Linear, Race Both!)
- ✅ Real-time step counter and statistics
- ✅ Adjustable animation speed
- ✅ Visual pointer tracking
- ✅ Color-coded search states

**Live Demo** | [Code](./day01-binary-search)

**Tech**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
**Time Complexity**: O(log n)  
**Key Learning**: Divide and conquer on sorted data

| 5 | Dijkstra's | O(E log V) | O(V) | Graph Shortest Path |
| 6 | Dynamic Programming | Varies | Varies | Optimization |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **UI**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Styling**: Custom gradients, animations, flexbox/grid
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

**Philosophy**: No frameworks, no build tools - just pure web technologies to focus on the algorithms!

## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

All projects are standalone and require no dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tyagirohan/Algorithms-in-Action.git

# Navigate to any project
cd Algorithms-in-Action/day01-binary-search

# Open in browser
start index.html  # Windows
open index.html   # Mac
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

Or simply visit the live demos! 🌐

## 💡 Why This Series?

### For Learning
- **Visual Understanding**: See algorithms in action, not just code
- **Interactive Practice**: Play with inputs and watch behavior change
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare different approaches side-by-side
- **Real-world Context**: Every project solves a practical problem

### For Portfolio
- **Stand Out**: Interactive projects > Static code
- **Demonstrable Skills**: Employers can try them instantly
- **Learning Journey**: Shows progression and commitment
- **Open Source**: Contribution-ready codebase
